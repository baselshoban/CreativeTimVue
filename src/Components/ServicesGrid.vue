	                <p>Accepting checks seems to be an outdated and risky way of accepting payment, but many businesses still do so.

Having a check “bounce” will not only hurt your business’s bottom line, but can incur additional fees depending on your financial institution’s policy</p>

	                <p>Credit card payment is the leading method of payment in the world next to cash. This method, however, often comes at a cost. Many credit card companies charge transactional fees (assessed per transaction), flat fees (assessed per month), and incidental fees (assessed under certain situations such as charge-backs). Visa and Mastercard dominate the market as they are widely accepted worldwide.</p>
